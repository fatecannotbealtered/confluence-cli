# Contributing to confluence-cli

*English | [中文](CONTRIBUTING_zh.md)*

Thanks for improving **confluence-cli** — Confluence Data Center CLI for AI Agents - manage pages, spaces, attachments, comments, labels, and CQL search. This document covers building, testing, and submitting changes.

## The build playbook lives in the specs

This repo is an **AI-native CLI tool**, designed for AI agents first. Before implementing or changing any feature, read the playbook:

- **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** — entry point; routes you to the local specs and the shared repo skeleton standard.
- **[`.agent/AGENT.md`](.agent/AGENT.md)** — the project playbook.
- **[`.agent/CLI-SPEC.md`](.agent/CLI-SPEC.md)** — the CLI output / error / write-loop contract.
- **[`.agent/SKILL-SPEC.md`](.agent/SKILL-SPEC.md)** — the AI Skill bundle spec.
- **[`.agent/SEC-SPEC.md`](.agent/SEC-SPEC.md)** — the security baseline (risk tiers, untrusted content, credentials, supply chain).

These specs are authoritative and take priority over default habits. Code that violates the CLI contract (stdout is the contract, uniform envelope, error triple, write loop) will not be merged.
